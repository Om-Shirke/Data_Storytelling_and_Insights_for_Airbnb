# Data_Storytelling_and_Insights_for_Airbnb
</br>

## üí° Project Description
This project analyzes Airbnb listings in New York to uncover key factors influencing revenue, customer preferences, and property performance. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and pricing analysis, actionable insights are derived to help business stakeholders optimize acquisition strategies, target high-demand neighborhoods, and improve property visibility. These insights enable Airbnb stakeholders to enhance user experience, boost occupancy rates, and drive revenue growth.

## üîß Tech Stack  

- **Languages & Tools:** Python, Excel, Tableau  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset:** `AB_NYC_2019.csv` (raw dataset) ‚Üí Cleaned & processed in `Cleaned Dataset.ipynb` ‚Üí Final dataset: `Cleaned_AirBnb.csv`  
- **Dataset Description:** `Dataset Description.png`  
- **Analysis Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Trend Analysis, Correlation Analysis, Data Visualization  

*(All datasets and notebooks are attached.)*

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering for better analysis.  
- **Visualization:** Used Tableau to create dashboards, heatmaps, and trend analyses, providing actionable business insights.  
- **Key Analysis Areas:** Customer segmentation, pricing trends, property demand, and location-based performance.  

## ‚ö° Key Findings & Insights  

- **Increase Availability of Entire Homes/Apartments:** The most popular room type in NYC is entire homes/apartments, but their availability throughout the year is limited. Expanding the number of days these listings can be rented will help meet demand and boost revenue.  

- **Target Optimal Pricing Range ($120-$140):** Listings within this price range are the most preferred by consumers. Encouraging hosts to price competitively in this range can enhance occupancy rates.  

- **Optimize Minimum Stay Requirements:**  
  - Focus on listings that offer a minimum stay of 1‚Äì2 days, as they are in high demand.  
  - Additionally, acquire hosts willing to offer long-term stays (around a month) to cater to tenants looking for extended accommodations.
